 Working on a supervised learning project involving the breast cancer dataset from the sklearn library
 1. Loading and Preprocessing:
    loaded the breast cancer dataset and performed some initial exploratory data analysis,
    such as checking for missing values, skewness, and duplicates.
    also standardized the dataset using StandardScaler, which is an essential step for algorithms like SVM and K-NN, which are sensitive to feature scales.
2. Implemented five different classifiers:   
    Logistic Regression
    Decision Tree Classifier
    Random Forest Classifier
    Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
3. Model comparison:
   Printed the accuracy scores and classification reports for each classifier.
   Based on the metrics, you can determine which model performed the best and which performed the worst using the accuracy.
4. Visualization:
   Plotted heatmaps for each algorithm using the confusion matrix.
